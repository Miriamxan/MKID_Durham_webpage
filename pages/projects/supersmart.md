SuperSMART is a novel spectroscopic concept designed to enable medium-resolution optical and near-infrared spectrophotometry for a wide range of astrophysical science cases, with a particular emphasis on Time Domain Astronomy.

The instrument is based on an array of small (0.6–1.0 m) commercially available telescopes, each operating as an independent light-collecting element. Light from each telescope is transmitted via one or more optical fibres to a central cryostat housing an array of Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs). Together, these channels form a medium-resolution spectrograph with resolving power R ≈ 5,000–10,000 and broad wavelength coverage spanning approximately 350–1800 nm.

SuperSMART adopts the KIDSpec spectrograph concept (O’Brien, JLTP, 2020), in which dispersed spectral orders are separated using the intrinsic energy resolution of MKIDs rather than conventional cross-dispersing optics. Light from each fibre is dispersed by an echelle grating onto a linear array of MKID pixels. The full two-dimensional detector format is constructed by arranging multiple fibres into a pseudo-slit, allowing multiple independent spectroscopic channels to be recorded simultaneously.

Each telescope feeds three fibres: one for the science target, one for a comparison star, and one for a simultaneous sky background measurement. This configuration enables precise spectrophotometric calibration and improves stability for time-resolved observations.

The telescope array can operate in two distinct modes. Telescopes may be distributed across the sky to observe multiple independent targets simultaneously, or they may be co-pointed at a single object. In the latter case, the detected photons from each telescope can be incoherently combined to produce the equivalent collecting area of a much larger aperture instrument. Because MKIDs are read-noise-free photon-counting detectors, this stacking process does not incur the noise penalties associated with conventional semiconductor detectors used in instruments such as ESO’s X-Shooter.

In addition, MKIDs provide precise time-tagging of every detected photon. This capability enables phase-folding and time-resolved spectroscopic techniques that are particularly powerful for studying short-period compact binaries and other rapidly variable systems.

By leveraging the favourable cost-to-aperture ratio of modern robotic telescopes, SuperSMART offers a scalable and flexible alternative to traditional monolithic 4–8 m class facilities. The concept combines high throughput, broadband coverage, and high temporal resolution, opening new discovery space for time-domain spectroscopy.

Current work focuses on refining the instrument architecture, exploring possible array configurations, and performing simulations of key science cases that highlight the unique capabilities enabled by the SuperSMART approach.
