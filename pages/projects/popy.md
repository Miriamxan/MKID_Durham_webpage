# POPY
## A Polychromatic Pyramid Wavefront Sensor for Extreme Adaptive Optics



## A Polychromatic Pyramid Wavefront Sensor for Extreme Adaptive Optics

---

Modern ground-based telescopes must observe through Earth’s turbulent atmosphere, which distorts incoming starlight and blurs astronomical images. Adaptive Optics (AO) systems correct these distortions in real time by measuring the incoming wavefront and adjusting a deformable mirror hundreds to thousands of times per second.

For high-contrast applications—such as the direct imaging of exoplanets—the quality of the AO correction is the single strongest factor determining how faint a planet can be detected next to its host star.

## Pyramid Wavefront Sensors

The **Pyramid Wavefront Sensor (PWFS)** is among the most sensitive wavefront sensing techniques currently available and is widely used in both existing and next-generation adaptive optics systems. However, its performance is ultimately limited by **non-linear response effects**, particularly under high-aberration or broadband conditions.

---

## The POPY Concept

The **POPY project** explores a new approach by pairing the PWFS with a **Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detector (MKID)** array.

MKIDs are superconducting detectors capable of measuring:

- the arrival time of each photon  
- the spatial position of detection  
- the photon energy (wavelength)

This enables photons to be sorted by wavelength **in real time**, opening the door to **polychromatic wavefront sensing**.

## Why MKIDs Transform Wavefront Sensing

Because MKIDs detect individual photons with:

- zero read noise  
- microsecond-level photon time tagging  
- intrinsic energy resolution  

they provide several transformative advantages for adaptive optics:

- **Simultaneous multi-wavelength wavefront sensing**, improving linearity and stability  
- **Temporal information** enabling time-aware reconstruction algorithms  
- **Enhanced performance for extreme adaptive optics (XAO)**, critical for high-contrast exoplanet imaging  

These capabilities directly address the fundamental limitations of conventional pyramid wavefront sensing.

## Scientific Impact

POPY is designed to demonstrate how MKID-enabled polychromatic sensing can:

- extend the linear regime of the PWFS  
- improve correction stability across broadband light  
- push extreme AO performance beyond current limits  

This approach is highly relevant for **future extremely large telescopes**, where achieving the required contrast for direct exoplanet detection will depend critically on next-generation wavefront sensing techniques.
