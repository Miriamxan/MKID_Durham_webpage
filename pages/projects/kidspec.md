KIDSpec (O’Brien et al., 2020) is a novel spectrograph concept designed to achieve medium spectral resolution, wide wavelength coverage, and high optical throughput. The instrument is specifically developed to exploit the full collecting power of modern large-aperture telescopes, where detector performance and photon efficiency increasingly dominate observational capability.

The design builds upon the original concept proposed by Cropper et al. (2003), combining a linear array of Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs) with an Echelle diffraction grating. In this configuration, light dispersed by the grating is spread into multiple spectral orders that overlap spatially on the detector. Unlike conventional spectrographs, these overlapping orders are not separated optically. Instead, the intrinsic energy resolution of MKIDs is used to identify the wavelength of each detected photon and thereby determine its diffraction order.

This approach removes the need for a cross-dispersing element, which in traditional Echelle spectrographs is required to separate overlapping orders onto a two-dimensional semiconductor detector. Instruments such as X-Shooter on the ESO Very Large Telescope employ a cross-disperser with a dispersion axis orthogonal to the Echelle grating. In contrast, KIDSpec achieves order separation directly at the detector level, allowing the entire spectrum to be recorded using a single one-dimensional MKID array.

The elimination of cross-dispersion optics significantly reduces optical complexity and improves throughput. Simulations of KIDSpec on the VLT indicate a gain in signal-to-noise ratio compared to X-Shooter, driven primarily by the zero read-noise performance of MKIDs and their resilience to cosmic-ray contamination. The combination of high quantum efficiency, photon counting, and energy discrimination enables efficient spectroscopy of extremely faint sources.

A key scientific driver for KIDSpec is the study of compact binary systems, particularly black hole and neutron star X-ray binaries. The dynamical masses of compact objects can be measured through radial velocity studies of binary components. However, many X-ray binaries are only optically bright during outburst phases, limiting access to spectral features from the donor star.

The detection of Bowen-blend fluorescence lines, first demonstrated by Steeghs et al. (2002), enables the velocity of the irradiated secondary star to be traced even during outburst. This technique has allowed dynamical mass measurements for approximately ten neutron star and black hole systems, including the first mass determination of the black hole in GX339–4 (Hynes et al., 2003).

The high throughput and exceptional temporal resolution of KIDSpec would enable similar measurements for a much larger population of systems. In particular, KIDSpec offers access to short-period and ultra-compact binaries, which are believed to be progenitors of future gravitational-wave sources. By combining broadband spectroscopy with microsecond time resolution, KIDSpec opens a new observational parameter space for time-domain astrophysics.
