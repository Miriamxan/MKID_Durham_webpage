Photon-counting detectors are revolutionising how we study variable and transient phenomena across the Universe. Our latest paper demonstrates how **Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs)** can deliver both **energy and time-resolved spectroscopy**, opening new pathways for observing **faint and rapidly varying astrophysical sources**.

By combining intrinsic energy resolution with microsecond timing capabilities, MKIDs enable detailed studies of **cataclysmic variables, pulsations, and exoplanet transits** that are beyond the reach of conventional CCD or CMOS systems.  

This work highlights Durhamâ€™s contribution to the next generation of **superconducting detector-based astronomical instrumentation** and the development of **KIDSpec**, our prototype MKID spectrograph.
